# Medical-Diagnosis-Using-AI
Using Machine Learning algorithms to predict the Lung disease, Diabetics, Parkinson's disease, Thyroid and Heart diseases.

**Problem Statement**

In today's healthcare system, medical diagnosis is often prone to human error or delays, as doctors face increasing amounts of patient data-symptoms, medical history, lab results, and imaging-making it hard to analyze everything quickly.
The complexity of diseases and varied patient symptoms further complicate decision-making, especially in high-pressure or resource-limited settings.
Key Challenges:
Complexity & High Stakes
Data Overload
Misdiagnosis Risks
Challenges in Disease Complexity

**Proposed Solution**

Al can streamline medical diagnosis by analyzing large volumes of patient data-symptoms, history, labs, and imaging-quickly and accurately.
In high-pressure settings like emergency rooms, Al can help detect critical conditions, such as heart attacks, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis.
By processing EHRs efficiently, Al ensures no crucial data is overlooked, supporting doctors in making faster, more informed decisions, even in complex or resource-limited scenarios.
This leads to improved accuracy, reduced diagnostic delays, and better patient outcomes.
